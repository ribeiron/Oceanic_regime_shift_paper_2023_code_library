# Oceanic_regime_shift_paper_2023_code_library
This is the repository for the code used for the manuscript: 

In the Figures folder, one can find all the code to reproduce the figures in the paper. 
The code for processing, investigating, testing, analysis and all the research work done prior to the publishing of this paper has been added here. However, it isn't very organized or easy to follow. It is a direct copy of my repository and the worst practices that I follow. 
The way it is, apart from the figures, this repository works as my backup. If you have trouble looking for something specific - because you will have trouble if you try - please contact me. 

The data folder contains all the seal raw data (.nc) used in this study together with a code to make sense of the metadata and the loaded .nc collections.
